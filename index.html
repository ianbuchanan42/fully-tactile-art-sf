      <h2>Why Tactile Art?</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a response to the continuous trend of art being enjoyed
        through vision, instead of also being seen through touch and other
        senses. We look to expand on this idea through creating a space for
        artists and patrons to explore this important conversation of what it
        means to "see" art.

      <h2>Upcoming Event: Staying in "Touch"</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 9th, 2025</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Jettison Creative<br />
        47 Jeff Adachi Way, San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Time:</strong> 12:00â€“3:00 pm (Presentations begin at 1:00 pm)
      </p>
      <p>
        This small scale and intimate exhibition will showcase the work of 5
        artists, some of which displayed work last year and some that are new to
        our programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be a presentation by the artists in conversation with Fully
        Tactile Art SF's project directors beginning at 1:00 pm. Discussions
        will follow the importance of accessibility in art exhibitions and how
        the creative process of the artists can be influenced by this work.

          <strong>Blink Pop Shift:</strong> Sharing with us a library of
          holdable, touchable sculptures that you can borrow, take home, and
          return like a book from the library. Each sculpture was created by San
          Francisco artist M Eilo to document the physical and emotional
          sensations of disability. The pieces were all made in the artist's
          home and they are excited to bring work from their home to yours. You
          can sign up to borrow from the art library at this event!
