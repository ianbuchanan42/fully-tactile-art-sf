This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for Fully Tactile Art SF, an organization dedicated to making art accessible through touch and multi-sensory experiences.

## Built with Next.js

This project leverages the power of Next.js for:

- Static site generation with `output: 'export'`
- React Server Components
- Image optimization
- Accessibility-focused components
- Type-safe development with TypeScript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deployment

This Next.js application is configured for static exports, making it easy to deploy to any static hosting service.

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files will be generated in the `out` directory.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
